## Overview

Laserstrike is a fast-paced first-person shooter developed as a Computer Graphics project. Players must navigate hostile environments while eliminating intelligent turret enemies that track and fire upon them. The game features immersive graphics techniques including real-time lighting, dynamic shadows, and particle effects.

## Key Features

- **Immersive First-Person Perspective** - Smooth camera controls with mouse look system
- **Intelligent Enemy AI** - Auto-aiming turrets with pathfinding capabilities
- **Dynamic Health System** - Visual vignette effects that intensify as you take damage
- **Realistic Physics** - Physics-based interactions and ragdoll deaths
- **Advanced Graphics** - PBR materials, custom shaders, and post-processing effects
- **Particle Systems** - Bullet trails, explosions, and impact effects

## Objective

Eliminate all turret enemies in each level to achieve victory. Avoid their laser fire and survive the onslaught to complete the game and achieve high scores.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **WASD** | Movement |
